About Me
</h>

<p>
Hi, my name is Zachary Rock. I am currently a senior in CVU, and am working full time at the Shaw's in Williston. I am currently learning computer programming for my Grad. Challenge because I have taken an interst on how machines are coded, and how they are told to do certain things that make them act the way they do. I have always been a technological kid, and I think as the future continues to grow more nad more, it would be cool to see how computer programming plays a huge part into it.
</p>

<h>
How I Started
</h>

<p> 
I started computer programming by getting into the interest about how do codes make a things work, and I wanted to know more than the simplisity of it, so I took actions into my own hands and saw Grad. Challenge as a way to do it. From there, I knew Charlie McFayden would know someone because he is into coding and all this technological stuff so my best bet of getting a community consultant was through maybe he knew someone. Since chatting with Brian i've learned more and more, and i knew this could be another potential pathway to take in life because not a lot of people know computer programming and it is a really hard field to get into and stay invested in. Plus, the future is all going to be technology anyways so it would be a good thing to know it case I need to code something for a business I own or maybe help a friend out with something.
</p>

<h>
Why I Wanted To Do This
</h>

<p>
Why I started is because is because in the past years of middle school i did basic coding, but nothing to this advcanced where I could actually write down the code and do it for myself,and show that it is more than is is made out to be. I also wanted more of a challenge because to potentially go to school for coding, you will need to know what attributes are, what are they used for, how to use them, etc. All that plays into making either a website, or a game, or a portfolio. What I thought was really cool is the different types of code that I could experience and carry on for the rest of my life incase I started a business and needed a webiste or maybe do it as a job in the near future.

Music I Like
</h>

<p> 
I listen to a lot of rap, hip hop, some rock and roll, and some pop. I mostly listen to rap because I am a person that list to listen to lyrics over rhythm. if the lyrics are there to make a really good song, I personally will enjoy it. The thing about rap is when a artist is singing the words really fast, if they do it right, they can go with the flow of the rhythm, and it ultimately makesw a really good song lyrically, but also really brings out the rhythm they are rapping too. A lot of those types of songs too also talk about problems they deal with and problems other deal with and some of those songs are pretty relatable to some people, which makes a really cool connection between the artist and the fans that listen to the songs. I listen to some rock and roll, but mostly the classics like guns and roses, The rolling stones, AC/DC, etc. Some pop artist I listen to are twnety one pilots, Drake, the weeknd, etc. I am not a fan of country, and songs without words, I think songs need words in order to really bring out the meaning of the song, but that's just my personal opinion.

Games I Play
</h>

<p> 
Some games I play are games like Call of Duty, Watch dogs, Minecraft, Counter Strike, etc. I play an assortment of games to try and expand my interst. I really enjoy to play multiplayer games because there is more to do when you play with friends vs playing with yourself in a singleplayer game. Singleplayer games are iffy for me, like I would really have to be invested into playing it, and have to have a really good and memorable story line for me to wanna play and to beat the game. The thing about singleplayer is too you have to do everything, and if something funny happens, it's better to share that type of stuff in the heat of the moment with a friend to maybe try and recreate that, or to do something else that is fun and interesting.

Future Plans
</h>

<p> 
Some future plans I have is to go to college for a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration and Management at the Corporate level. I am a supervisor at my job now so I do have some experience and I have been recommended to be the assistant at my job. My higher up bosses think I could really go far in the field I want to go in because of my experience, and think that I could possibly go really far in life with a degree that deals with management. I also want to go into that field because I like running something and doing things my way, because I try to simplify things to make them easier not just for me, but for other people as well. I am also pretty OCD when it comes to certain things like work, so I really wanna do a good job and get it done in a timely manner and in the right manner as well. Working during the COVID-19 period has also gave me a differnet output and a different way of looking at some things like management so it would be cool to share my experience with others and to go into a field that has a general meaning. Plus with Business Administration at the Corporate level you can do more than just a basic manager of a department, and that experience can take you far in life personally as well.
